    "In this Biweekly Report, I will be discussing on learning Python because it is a computer language that I never used.  The task for me was to learn the basics of Python such as the loops, the data types, and the syntax in preparation of this course.  I will be showing a simple Rock, Paper, Scissor Game that was used in the following Youtube video, https://youtu.be/N94vSNBF-EI?si=JCvoLqUrsg8wFedQ.\n"

    "While learning to use Python, I researched the differences between C++ and Python using this article from the website Real Python, https://realpython.com/python-vs-cpp/#syntax-differences.  In C++, you have to declare the variables with an int, double, string, or etc. whereas Python did not require varables since everythin is an object.  Whitespaces are crucial when coding with Python because it does not have the curly braces to set the scope whereas C++ uses curly braces.  In addition, the Python syntax was written to where it can be readable to to users, however, it is slower than C++.  "
